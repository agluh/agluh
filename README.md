### Hi there, Alexey Glukharev is here :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

:computer: I've spent the last six years developing and maintaining different web applications. At first it was a hobby, but now I do it for a living. I started as a PHP developer, but recently switched to Java :coffee: and I enjoy it.

:man_student: Currently I'm learning Java Spring and Spring Boot at Yandex.Practicum courses. A few projects from there can be found in my profile.

:heart: I'm trying to write clean code and I really like a good software architecture. I try to read more books on this topic :books: and watch the conferences of other developers.

:envelope: You can always reach me at glukharevalexey@gmail.com

:eyes: I am currently looking for a job as a Java developer.
